 - IMPORTANT - Update stmt::enumDecl IMMEDIATELY after adding longs

- Implement constant flags and allow native functions to pass them (for example, O_RDONLY or O_CREAT in @open)
  - Kind of, but only for boolean literals. Nowhere else besides that though

 Add in proper support for arrays and index over strings, arrays, etc. - Add standard test for this.

 TODO: Fix the typeCheckers indexing for chars

 add in the lsp fully
  Fix Hover requests to be put in the right place
  Fix Completion requests to not just hang and eventually crash (Infinite loop?)
 NOTE: Read into the calling convention for the lsp to comminicat with vscode and nvim respectfully
 NOTE: Good source for lsp integration

Allow integer literals to be inferred into whatever size they need; kind of like the signedness except for char, longs, shorts, etc.

A test for if adding TCP/HTTP requests
Change @input/@output to be @read/@write and make file descriptor manually declared (0 for stdin; 1 for stdout)
Pointers implemented now. Still backwards from C declarations tho but shh
   - Implement sockets (HTTP requests ??)
   - Note for HTTP:
      - $ man 2 socket
          @socket(DOMAIN, TYPE, PROTOCOL) ->
          - the protocol of communication- IPv4 sized addresses
          - the, well, type of connection- SOCK_STREAM = 'sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams'
          - 0 lol
          - on return : file descriptor
          
          @bind(FD, *ADDR, ADDRLEN) ->
          - file descriptor returned by @socket
          - an address to a struct (the members don't really matter as it will just be type punned)
          - sizeof previous struct
          - on return : status code (success/error)

          @accept(FD, *ADDR, *ADDRLEN) ->
          - file descriptor returned by @socket
          - these could technically be null if we wanted lol but its basically the same as @bind

          Congratulations! Just read from the socket file descriptor and that is that.
          Make sure to close it before reading another!

TRHEN WE AT VERSION 1 BABY!
