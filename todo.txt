Add in control flow to the codegen (done => if, for, switch, while)
NOTE: Read into switch statements "jump tables", and how to emit them in ASM. => Kind of done. Need more research.

Add and recognize more int types in asm. (Ex. byte, short, long, quad).
 - IMPORTANT - Update stmt::enumDecl IMMEDIATELY after adding longs

 Implement an open/close method that returns a fd. Can be easily implemented in @output and @input
 Add in alloc, free, cast, memcpy, and sizeof functions. (done => alloc, free, cast, sizeof, memcpy)

 Add in proper support for arrays and index over strings, arrays, etc.

 Add in uint and int types.

 TODO: Fix the typeCheckers indexing for chars as well as nested member exprs. (Fixed: nested member expr)

 add in the lsp fully
 NOTE: Read into the calling convention for the lsp to comminicat with vscode and nvim respectfully
 NOTE: Good source for lsp integration

A test for if adding TCP/HTTP requests
Change @input/@output to be @read/@write and make file descriptor manually declared (0 for stdin; 1 for stdout)
Pointers implemented now. Still backwards from C declarations tho but shh
   - Implement sockets (HTTP requests ??)
   - Note for HTTP:
      - $ man 2 socket
          @socket(DOMAIN, TYPE, PROTOCOL) ->
          - the protocol of communication- IPv4 sized addresses
          - the, well, type of connection- SOCK_STREAM = 'sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams'
          - 0 lol
          - on return : file descriptor
          
          @bind(FD, *ADDR, ADDRLEN) ->
          - file descriptor returned by @socket
          - an address to a struct (the members don't really matter as it will just be type punned)
          - sizeof previous struct
          - on return : status code (success/error)

          @accept(FD, *ADDR, *ADDRLEN) ->
          - file descriptor returned by @socket
          - these could technically be null if we wanted lol but its basically the same as @bind

          Congratulations! Just read from the socket file descriptor and that is that.
          Make sure to close it before reading another!

TRHEN WE AT VERSION 1 BABY!
