Add in control flow to the codegen (done => if, for, switch, while)
NOTE: Read into switch statements "jump tables", and how to emit them in ASM. => Kind of done. Need more research.

Add and recognize more int types in asm. (Ex. byte, short, long, quad).
 - IMPORTANT - Update stmt::enumDecl IMMEDIATELY after adding longs

 Add in stdin and stdout. As well as read and write (for files)
 Add in calloc, malloc, realloc, free

 add in the lsp fully
 NOTE: Read into the calling convention for the lsp to comminicat with vscode and nvim respectfully
 NOTE: Good source for lsp integration

A test for if adding TCP/HTTP requests
Pointers implemented now. Still backwards from C declarations tho but shh
   - Implement sockets (HTTP requests ??)
   - Note for HTTP:
      - $ man 2 socket
      - Socket Syscall #: SYS_socket 41
      - Socket Domain:    AF_INET (ip v4) 2
      - Socket type:      SOCK_STREAM 1
      - Bind Syscall #:   SYS_bind 49
      - Listen Syscall #: SYS_listen 50
      - Accept Syscall #: SYS_accept 43
      - Read Syscall #:   SYS_read 0
      - Write Syscall #:  SYS_WRITE 1 (Already implemented in the form of 'dis')
