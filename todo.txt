Add in control flow to the codegen (done => if, for, switch; still need => while)
NOTE: Read into switch statements "jump tables", and how to emit them in ASM. => Kind of done. Need more research.

Add bool type to debug DIEs.
Fix random bug where only in debug mode that function calls on structs are incorrect
Fix random bug that some functions start with bad %rbp offsets

Add and recognize more int types in asm. (Ex. byte, short, long, quad).
 - IMPORTANT - Update stmt::enumDecl IMMEDIATELY after adding longs

A test for if adding TCP/HTTP requests
Pointers implemented now. Still backwards from C declarations tho but shh
   - Implement sockets (HTTP requests ??)
   - Note for HTTP:
      - $ man 2 socket
      - Socket Syscall #: SYS_socket 41
      - Socket Domain:    AF_INET (ip v4) 2
      - Socket type:      SOCK_STREAM 1
      - Bind Syscall #:   SYS_bind 49
      - Listen Syscall #: SYS_listen 50
      - Accept Syscall #: SYS_accept 43
      - Read Syscall #:   SYS_read 0
      - Write Syscall #:  SYS_WRITE 1 (Already implemented in the form of 'dis')
