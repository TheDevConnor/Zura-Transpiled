Just get back what we once had

DONE!!! Variables added to `-8(%rbp)` rather than arbitrarily on the stack

Add in control flow to the codegen (done => if, for) (strill need => switch, while)
Fix Functions so that they can return a usable value !!! - working on it
Add in struct, enums, and unions !!!
Print integers using a native function

Fix the issue where we can only lex up to a 32-bit value
